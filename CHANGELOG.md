**BEHAVIOUR CHANGES**
- `Headers` forces keys to be lowercase (part of the HTTP/2 spec).
- `Request` validates arguments differently, may not throw exception where
  previously thrown (e.g. allows `Stream<List<int>>` as body).

New features:

- `Request` constructor now accepts:
  - `form` (url-encoded body and also sets `content-type` header)
  - `json` (json-encoded body and also sets `content-type` header)
  - `cookies` (sets `cookie` header)

## 1.1.0

- Updated sources: removed `new` keyword.
- `Request.timeout` for limiting the timeout at the lowest level of the network, other framework-related operations do
  not count against it.

## 1.0.4

- `Request.change` to override `url`, `headers` or `body`. `addHeader` to extend current headers.

## 1.0.3

- `CloseClientFn` in `UpdatingClient`.

## 1.0.2

- Class-level `invalidateOnError` and `forceCloseOnError` for `UpdatingClient`.
- `TrackingClient.toString()` forwards to delegate client.

## 1.0.1

- Automatic `Content-Length` header when body is specified (in `ConsoleClient`).

## 1.0.0+1

- Fix: cleanup of past clients in `UpdatingClient`.

## 1.0.0

**BREAKING CHANGES**
- `Request.body` is used instead of `bodyStream` and `bodyBytes`.
- `Stream<List<int>>` inputs are no longer supported, use restartable `FutureOr<Stream<List<int>>> StreamFn()` instead.
- Single `Response` constructor, `body` become an untyped holder (use `bodyAsStream` if migrating uses). 

Other updates

- Explicit expiration, and optional on-exception expiration in `UpdatingClient`.
- Support form-encoded values as request body.
- Support `File` with `Request.body` on `ConsoleClient`.
- Support native request types with `Request.body` and `Response.body` on `BrowserClient`.

- Support `Response.done` to indicate when the underlying input stream has been read and completed.

    for apps that want to be packaged as a single binary (e.g. `.exe`)
